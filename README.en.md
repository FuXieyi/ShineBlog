## üöÄ How to Use

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm add sharp
   ```
   * If you haven't installed pnpm yet, run `npm install -g pnpm` first
4. Customize your blog settings in `src/config.ts`
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start the local development server
6. Create new posts using `pnpm new-post <filename>` and edit them in `src/content/posts/`

## üîÑ Notion Integration and Auto-Sync

This template has built-in Notion auto-sync functionality, allowing you to periodically sync content from a Notion database to your blog and automatically deploy updates.

### 1. Create a Notion Database

Create a database in Notion with the following properties:
- `Name` (title): Article title
- `Published` (date): Publication date
- `Updated` (date): Update date
- `Description` (rich text): Article description
- `Image` (URL): Cover image link
- `Tags` (multi-select): Article tags
- `Category` (select): Article category
- `Public` (checkbox): Controls whether to publish publicly
- `Lang` (select): Article language

### 2. Configure Notion API

1. Create a [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Get your API key
3. Add your integration to the database's sharing settings
4. Copy the database ID (from the URL)

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
NOTION_API_KEY=your-notion-api-key
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your-notion-database-id
```

### 4. Manual Content Synchronization

Run the following command to sync content from Notion:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-notion.js
```

Or test your Notion connection:

```bash
node scripts/test-notion.js
```

### 5. Enable Automatic Synchronization

The template has automatic sync disabled by default, with only manual triggering enabled. To enable automatic synchronization, follow these steps:

1. Edit the `.github/workflows/vercel-build.yml` file
2. Uncomment the following section (remove the `#` symbols):
   ```yaml
   schedule:
     - cron: '0 2 * * *' # Trigger automatically every day at 2 AM UTC
   ```
3. If needed, adjust the cron expression to change the sync frequency (default is every day at 2 AM UTC)

### 6. Vercel and GitHub Automated Deployment Setup

#### Vercel Deployment Configuration:

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and import your GitHub repository
2. In deployment settings, choose:
   - Framework preset: `Astro`
   - Build command: `pnpm build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Install command: `pnpm install`
3. Set environment variables (if needed)
4. Click the "Deploy" button to complete initial deployment

#### Create a Vercel Deploy Hook:

1. In your Vercel project settings, find the "Git" tab
2. Scroll down to the "Deploy Hooks" section
3. Create a new hook (e.g., named "Notion Auto Sync")
4. Select the branch to deploy (typically `main`)
5. Copy the generated URL

#### GitHub Secrets Configuration:

Add the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
1. Go to repository's `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK`: Paste the deploy hook URL copied from Vercel
   - `NOTION_API_KEY`: Your Notion API key
   - `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`: Your Notion database ID

### 7. Manual Sync Triggering

Even without enabling automatic synchronization, you can manually trigger the sync process at any time:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository
2. Find the "Auto Sync Notion and Deploy" workflow in the left sidebar
3. Click "Run workflow"

### 8. Sync Mechanism Explanation

This workflow uses an intelligent sync mechanism that will automatically:

1. Fetch the latest content from Notion
2. Intelligently filter non-substantial changes (like S3 image URL signatures, metadata timestamps, etc.)
3. Create a new commit only when substantial content changes are detected
4. Trigger Vercel deployment to update your website
